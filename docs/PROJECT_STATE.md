## Current operational state

- The original Windows media-session watcher remains read only.
- The verified target is exactly one eligible, Playing `firefox.exe` GSMTC session. Missing or ambiguous targeting produces silence.
- Automatic radio behavior schedules one comment every 2-5 genuine transitions. It prepares Track-A local AI text and Nicole audio one transition early while Firefox keeps playing.
- At Track B, the application revalidates the logical Firefox media target and exactly one active Firefox Core Audio session inside a two-second delivery window.
- Normal delivery never pauses Firefox. It captures the Firefox application-session scalar/mute state, ducks proportionally to 25%, speaks over continuing music, and restores the exact captured state in protected cleanup.
- Harmless Firefox GSMTC wrapper refreshes preserve preparation, active speech, and the current schedule. Unsafe or genuinely different target states cancel protected work before any reacquisition.
- Ollama remains loopback-only with `qwen3:4b-instruct`, deterministic validation/fallback, `--no-ai`, and normal `keep_alive: 0` unloading.
- Kokoro `af_nicole` is the accepted primary CPU voice; `af_heart` is runner-up and Windows local TTS is fallback.
- Recent state remains process-local and bounded to 10 tracks and 6 accepted AI comments. There is no persistent listening history or catch-up queue.

Full implemented behavior is in [CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Latest verification

- Production Release build: passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Test-project Release build: passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Complete automated suite: 124 passed, 0 failed.
- Production and test-project formatting verification: passed.
- Automatic tests use fakes and did not produce speech, control desktop playback, or change real volume.

## Milestone 7.5B acceptance evidence

- Firefox transitions remained observable during Chrome/YouTube global GSMTC churn.
- Fifty-nine harmless wrapper refresh diagnostics were treated as logical continuity, with no false replacement/reacquisition and no interruption to generation, Nicole synthesis, prepared material, active speech, or the current interval.
- Two prepared announcements completed while wrapper refreshes continued during speech.
- Both deliveries used only Firefox Core Audio PID 11568 / session `7D62879DB482` and restored exactly from 100% to 25% to 100%.
- Chrome remained untouched, normal delivery did not pause Firefox, and Ctrl+C shut down cleanly.
- The accepted local evidence is preserved in `logs\radio-behavior-test-20260810-131308-866.txt` and summarized in [MILESTONE_7_5B_TEST.md](MILESTONE_7_5B_TEST.md).

## Immediate blockers and deferred observations

- There is no active M7.5B blocker. Milestone 8 has no approved detailed scope and must not start without a bounded request.
- The earlier 20:49 observer stall remains intermittent, unresolved, and unreproduced by the accepted Firefox-plus-Chrome run.
- Wrapper-refresh diagnostics are excessively repetitive; this is a deferred non-blocking logging-quality issue.
- Other accepted limitations and deferred improvements are maintained in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
