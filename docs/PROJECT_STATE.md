# Project state

## Current milestone

Milestone 0 is complete. Milestone 1 has not started at this checkpoint.

## Completed milestones

**Milestone 0 - PASSED manual acceptance on Steve's Windows PC.**

- Firefox exposed the intended session as `firefox.exe`.
- YouTube Music title, artist, Playing/Paused state, and live track changes were detected correctly.
- Album was consistently unavailable and remains optional; it must never be guessed.
- Repeated unchanged `MediaPropertiesChanged` events did not create duplicate `TRACK CHANGED` reports.
- The read-only probe shut down cleanly and issued no playback controls.

## Known issues and limits

- Windows or Firefox may omit album information. The probe displays `<not provided>` and does not treat that as an error.
- Windows may expose zero sessions when no compatible media is active. The probe reports that without crashing.
- The automated `--once` run under the non-interactive Codex sandbox account was denied access to the Windows media-session manager. Steve's manual test confirmed the normal signed-in desktop account works correctly.

## Important decisions and evidence

- The probe is a C#/.NET 8 console application using only `GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager` and `GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSession` for runtime media observation.
- It targets Windows 10 and uses the supported Windows Runtime API introduced in Windows 10 version 1809.
- It enumerates all sessions and keeps the raw `SourceAppUserModelId` visible. Firefox recognition is only a case-insensitive hint based on the raw identifier returned by Windows.
- It subscribes to session-list, media-property, and playback-info changes. Track identity is exactly the normalized title/artist/album combination, which prevents duplicate `TRACK CHANGED` messages for an identical state.
- No playback-control API, browser automation, browser data access, AI, speech, or runtime networking is included.
- Build tooling is project-local: Microsoft .NET SDK 8.0.423 and Microsoft's `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref` targeting pack. Neither requires administrator privileges.
